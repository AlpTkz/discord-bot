"Welcome to **SwissRPG**! We hope you'll enjoy rolling dice with us. Here is some basic info to get you started.

**Got a question about SwissRPG?**
Ask at the #tavern and someone will help you out. If you need help from an organiser, just hit them up with the @Organiser tag.

**Are you a GM or aspire to be one?**
- If you would like be a GM for our community, please get in touch with @Alp. We offer great resources to our GMs like access to public venues, most D&D books and PDF adventures.
- If you're interested in being a GM but don't feel ready, let us know. We've provided support to many beginner GMs to get them started.

**Support our group**
SwissRPG aims to enable people to play role playing games. If you find value in what we do, please consider supporting us here (https://rebi.me/swissrpg) with a donation. Every donation makes a big difference. Thank you for your support.

**Basic rules of our community**
**1.** If you would like to promote an event, another tabletop group, a discord channel etc. please ask an @Organiser first.
**2.** Be inclusive and respectful of others and their differences.
**3.** Stay positive, love each other. Life is good.

**_Don’t forget to introduce yourself to our community in the #tavern channel. Don't be shy, we're all very nice._**";
